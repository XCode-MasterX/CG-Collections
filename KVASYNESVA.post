Title: Hello, how are you?
Type: Request
Content: Hello, my name is Arpan. This is my formal post to welcome to this "site". You can make all sorts of demands here. You make the requests, someone claims your request because they can fulfill it. That's how it works.

You can also make a post saying that you have something, the "Demand" type of posts. Someone claims your item, and the post will not be able to be claimed by anyone else.
